**Molecular Statistical Physics for Kinetics and Thermochemistry**

**Author:** Peter Szabo

MARXUS is a molecular statistical-physics toolkit for **thermochemistry** and **chemical kinetics**, aimed at partition functions, state counting, and statistical rate theories (TST/RRKM/PST/SACM) for gas-phase reactions.

## Features

### Thermochemistry
- Partition functions
- Thermodynamic functions: **U, H, F, G, S, Cv, Cp**
- Equilibrium constants

### Kinetics
- Canonical TST (high-pressure limit) reaction rate coefficients
- RRKM / microcanonical TST: **E-dependent rate constants** *(μ-canonical TST)*
- Sum and density of states: *(E- or E,J-resolved)*
- Barrierless reactions:
  - Phase Space Theory (PST) with **1D arbitrary potential** !!! In progress !!!
  - Statistical Adiabatic Channel Method (SACM) !!! In progress !!!
- Energy-resolved Master Equation (E-dependent) !!! In progress !!!

## To Do (not implemented yet)
- Inverse Laplace Transform methods
- Microcanonical Variational TST (μVTST)
- Canonical Variational TST (CVTST)
- Submerged barrier with a pre-reaction vdW complex: **μ-canonical, J-resolved 2-TST treatment**
